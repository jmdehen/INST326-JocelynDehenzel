Week 5 (Project): I asked Claude to create functions for the Function Library project. After that, I reviewed the code to ensure that it was accurate. All of the functions recieved AI assistance. I validated each function by ensureing that it ran correctly in VS code. By using AI, I learned better ways to fact-check code and better understand how functions work. To improve the AI-generated code, I ran it through AI again to make sure there were no erros. Here is the link to the chat: https://claude.ai/share/e6d6231b-181e-4f8c-b77d-ec21a9bb10e7
Week 6: I used Claude AI to help generate initial code for my weekly exercises, and then I worked with Claude to debug errors and understand what the code was doing.
